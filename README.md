# HackBU2020
Hackathon project for HackBU

TODO:
-	Agree on how data is sent between frontend and backend (via JSON or path)
-	If data is sent via JSON, agree on a format (quantity, price, side, etc.) so front/back-end know what is going on.
-	Kurt: need to reinstall anaconda because I screwed it up again :(
-	Fix machine learning part. Rutvik knows more about this. 
-	Enable creation of multiple accounts (check for username duplicates and hash passwords before storing in mongodb).
-	Add balance at any time when account is created.
